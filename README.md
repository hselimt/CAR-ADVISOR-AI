## ✨ What It Does

Enter your budget and preferences, and watch as 6 specialized AI agents compete to find you the perfect car. Each agent analyzes the market, recommends 2-3 cars with detailed specs, and argues why their picks are best. Each agent represents a different market segment and advocates for their brands. A jury evaluates all recommendations and crowns the ultimate winner based on performance, safety, value, and your needs.

**Think of it as:** A panel of expert car salespeople debating which car is best for you - but faster, unbiased, and powered by AI.

**7 Specialized Agents:**
- 💎 Ultra-Luxury (Porsche, Bentley, Ferrari)
- ⭐ Premium (BMW, Mercedes, Audi)
- 🎯 Upper-Mainstream (VW, Mazda, Subaru)
- 🔧 Mainstream (Toyota, Honda, Hyundai)
- 💸 Budget (Dacia, Fiat, Renault)
- ⚡ Electric (Tesla, BYD, Polestar)
- 🏆 Jury
